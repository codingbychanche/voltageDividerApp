    This App facilitates the calculation of some properties of resistors. It can be checked if ones
    calculated resistor value is included in any of the standard series E3 - E96 within a given
    error margin. Two resistor voltage dividers can be calculated when input and output voltages are known.
<p>
    Please note: The standard values for the resistors are calculated. This leads to miner errors between
    calculated and available resistors. Usually this error is not bigger than 1/100.

    This App is for free and I do not intent to include add's for the time being. If you like this App or want
    to improve it, please write into the comments or send me an e- mail.
